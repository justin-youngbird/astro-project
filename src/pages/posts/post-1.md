# my first blog post

Published on 4/3/2025

welcom to my _new blog_ about learning astro! here i will share my learning journy as I build my new website

## what I have accomplished

1. **Installing astro**: First, I created a new astro project and set up my online accounts
2. **Making pages**: I then learned how to make pages using the new `.astro` files by placing them in `/src/pages/` folder. 
3. **Making blog posts**: This is my first blog post! I now have astro pages and markdown posts! I dont know Markdown :( ...yet

##  whats next

I will finish the astro tutorial, and keep adding more posts. watch this space for more to come, or don't. actually please don't.
